# Instructions:
# For each of the following code snippets, trace the values of the variables
# and determine the final output of each snippet. Write down your answers.



# 1. Arithmetic and Variable Assignment

# x = 10
# y = 5
# z = x + y * 2
# x += y - 3
# print(z,x)

# 2. Comparison and Logical Operators

# a = 7
# b = 14
# c = a * 2
# result = c == b and a < b
# print(c, result)


# 3. Complex Arithmetic

# x = 4
# y = 8
# z = (x + y) * 2 - 10
# print(z)

# 4. Chained Comparison

# a = 6
# b = 10
# check = 5 < a < b < 15
# print(check)


# 5. Logical and Arithmetic Combined

# x = 12
# y = 7
# z = x // y + 3 > 4 or x % y == 0
# print(z)

# 6. Arithmetic and Logical Operators
